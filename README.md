# DIY Lithium charger


<b>First of all, I'm not in any way responsible for any damage that 
could be an outcome of using any part of this circuit.
Lithium batteries are dangerous and shouldn't be handled by unexperienced
persona. Never leave your packs unattended.</b>


I'm aiming to develop a cheap, safe, easy to build and multi-channel lithium charger.
Everyone knows that you can already buy things like iMax B6 clones or whatever. Simple answer is 
those chargers only allow you to charge one battery at a time and their balancing current is less than enough
for anyone that built a battery from used or mismatched cells.

Main goals:<b>

    Independent, balanced channels,
    Easy and cheap to expand,
    Possibly the smallest form factor,
    Wide input and output voltage range, 
    Making it safe to use.

Please remember that it is all work in progress.
